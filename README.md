# Data Science Project / Portfolio: Mini Lectures (DSC4900)

This repository contains my materials for **two mini lectures** completed as part of **DSC4900**.  
The lectures are designed to demonstrate both **practical technical skills** and **theoretical understanding** relevant to data science.

- **Practical Mini Lecture:** SQL fundamentals using a Matcha business dataset  
- **Theory Mini Lecture:** Conceptual data science topic (non-coding)

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 1 Practical Mini Lecture — *Learning SQL with Matcha*  
📄 **Slides (PDF)**  
📄 **SQL Files**

This lecture introduces core SQL concepts through a hands-on, example-driven approach.

**Topics covered:**
- `SELECT`
- `WHERE`
- `ORDER BY`
- `JOIN`
- `COUNT`, `SUM`, `LIKE`
- `GROUP BY`

**Materials include:**
- A slide deck explaining SQL concepts and motivations
- A database setup SQL file creating a realistic Matcha business dataset
- A SQL resource + mini-lab with demo queries and practice problems

This lecture is designed to be taught in approximately **20 minutes** and emphasizes real-world data querying.

### 2 Theory Mini Lecture  
📄 **Slides (PDF)**  
📄 **Resource & Practical Guide (LaTeX / PDF)**  

This lecture provides a high-level theoretical overview of neural networks, how they work, and how they are applied in modern AI systems.

### Topics Covered:

- AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning  
- Biological inspiration of neural networks  
- Neuron computation:
  - Weighted sum  
  - Bias  
  - Activation functions  
- Network architecture:
  - Input layer  
  - Hidden layers  
  - Output layer  
- Forward propagation  
- Backpropagation and gradient descent (conceptual overview)  
- Epochs and batch training  
- Train / Validation / Test split  
- From shallow networks to deep learning  
- Real-world applications:
  - ChatGPT (Transformer Neural Networks)  
  - Self-driving cars (Convolutional Neural Networks)  
  - Fraud detection  
  - Medical diagnosis  

### Learning Objectives:

After this lecture, students should be able to:

- Explain how a neural network makes predictions  
- Describe how neural networks learn through optimization  
- Define key terms such as epoch, batch, loss, and generalization  
- Connect neural network theory to real-world AI systems  

This lecture is designed to be delivered in approximately **20 minutes** and focuses on conceptual clarity rather than implementation.
